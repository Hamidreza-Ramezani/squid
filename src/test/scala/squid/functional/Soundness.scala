    /* We used to check method call return types, now we don't (for flexibility reasons).
     * We also match method type arguments covariantly.
     * This combination seems like it could lead to unsoundness... (see below)
     * but in practice, I found that everything seems to remain fine.
     * Some observations:
     *  - The Right Thing to do would be to match method type parameters with the variance according to the method's
     *    signature, but that would be pretty complex (and probably expensive) to implement.
     *  - In fact, it seems we could get away with not checking method type arguments at all! Indeed, any actual
     *    unsoundness (besides potential ones mentioned below that rely on features we don't yet have) will have to at
     *    some point extract a value to do something with â€” but the types of extracted values _are_ always checked, so
     *    problematic cases cannot arise in practice. That's why it's fine, for now, to match them covariantly. We don't
     *    actually want to remove any check on them, because there might be holes waiting to get filled in by the check.
     *    A credible alternative would be to implement bivariant extraction for them.
     *  - This covariant matching turned out problematic in dbStage when I was trying to match types, using `Set[$t]` as
     *    the scrutinee and `Set[T]` as the patterns. But that just goes to show we should have a proper first-class way
     *    of matching types instead! In the meantime, one can use `$_: Set[$t]` as the patterns, which will be matched
     *    invariantly because the _type_ Set is invariant. */
